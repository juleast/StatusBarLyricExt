# StatusBarLyricExt - by Juleast
Forked from [KaguraRinko](https://github.com/KaguraRinko)'s [StatusBarLyricExt](https://github.com/KaguraRinko/StatusBarLyricExt)

This tool adds the function to show lyrics on the status bar using [MediaSession](https://developer.android.google.cn/reference/android/media/session/MediaSession).

Currently status bar lyrics is only supported on [Flyme](https://www.flyme.com/) and [exTHmUI](https://www.exthmui.cn/)

## How it works
- Currently playing media information is obtained with [MediaController](https://developer.android.google.cn/reference/android/media/session/MediaController).
- After the lyric information is retrieved online, it will be displayed on the status bar.

## Projects used
- [LyricView](https://github.com/markzhai/LyricView)
